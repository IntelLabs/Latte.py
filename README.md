Documentation is built with mkdocs.  This must be done on a local system with a
web browser, or a remote system configured to forward port 8000 for viewing.
Note that this documentation can be viewed without installing the Latte Python
package or any of its dependencies (i.e. this can be done on your laptop for
documentation viewing and editing even if you develop on a remote server)

To generate and view documentation:
```bash
# Install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs
# Run server to view documentation
mkdocs serve
# View documentation at 127.0.0.1:8000
```
